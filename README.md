## Overview

This is the fifth challenge on the **JavaScript Fundamentals Frontend Mentor Roadmap**. it focuses on styling using html/css and on getting the data of the interface from a local data.json file.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I used `fetch` to grab the local json file and svgs. loop over the data and populate each of the score components.

I used the `DOMParser` interface to parse the svg files that are fetched and inject them into the page.
